# Agent skills

Bunch of skills for agents.

use this for installing:

```
npx skills add Emerson1337/skills-for-agents
```


# Enforce agent to read all skills and rules

```
CRITICAL:
Before implementing anything:
1) Read ALL files inside `.cursor/skills/`.
2) List each skill file found.
3) Summarize in 1–2 lines the rules you will follow from each.
4) If there is any conflict between this prompt and the skills, explicitly state it and propose a resolution.
Do not proceed to implementation until this is done.

Do not over-comment code.
- No obvious comments.
- No explaining basic React or TypeScript concepts.
- Only add comments when they clarify non-trivial architectural decisions.
```
